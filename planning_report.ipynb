    "Selected broad question: *What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types? (question 1)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific question: **Can a player's age, total hours played, experience, and average play time duration within a session predict if a player would subscribe to a game-related newsletter using the players and sessions dataset?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classification problem, so we use predictive variables to classify a player as subscribing or not subscribing to a game-related newsletter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `players.csv` data can easily be used since it has many variables about player characteristics. `sessions.csv` data can also be used since the hashed email can be linked to a player. One possible metric from `sessions.csv` is the average session duration that the player plays for; we can group by email, create a new column called AverageSessionDuration based on EndTime - StartTime, and summarize an average for each email. Then, we can use bind_col to add AverageSessionDuration to players and use it as a predictive variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "After wrangling the data, we can use k-nn classification to train a model, but we should probably separate our data into training/testing, tune for the best k-value, then retrain, and apply the model on the testing set to determine how good our model is."
